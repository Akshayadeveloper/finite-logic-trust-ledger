<b>FINITE LOGIC: TrustLedger - Event Sourcing Fabric</b>

TrustLedger is a conceptual framework for immutable Event Sourcing in a microservice architecture. Unlike traditional databases that store the current state, TrustLedger stores every single state-changing event as a permanent record.

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

Guarantees data integrity and provides a perfect, temporal audit trail across complex distributed services. By storing "what happened" (the events) rather than "what is now" (the state), you can rebuild any past state perfectly, crucial for debugging, auditing, and regulatory compliance.
